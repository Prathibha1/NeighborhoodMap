# Neighborhood Map Project

This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. It's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes Google Maps and other location-based services like Foursquare.

## Project Features

 It includes the content about the **Indian National Parks**. and some description about the parks.
 
The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map. There's also extra info pulled from Foursquare where available.

The app is responsive, too! It resizes using CSS Flexbox and media queries. It can recalibrate itself based on your screen size -- try resizing the window!
